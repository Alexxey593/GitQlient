0. Remove unnecessary files from the repo

1. Pre-release tasks
- Add icon

2. Improvements
- Amend a commit that is not the last one: amend + rebase
- Amend a commit already pushed
- Add functionality to squash commits
   - This needs a new screen when the user needs to change the command in the editor
- Merge solving (create new UI view):
   - Show the conflicts of a merge and/or cherry-pick styled in the unstaged files list
   - Ask to show the results of the merge in GitQlient in a different window (File editor)
- Add file vs file diff as option (Check options: DiffEditor plugin from QtCreator or other)
- Show a progress bar or custom waiting mouse icon when loading a new repo
- When generating patch, add option to open folder. QtCreator does that platform independently

File diff:
- How we handle when a file changes its directory? Do we need to download the old one to do the diff?

Full diff:
- Move to the file diff chunck when user clics the file

Future:
- Implement modification browsing in FileDiffView
- Credentials management!!
