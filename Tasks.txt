0. Remove unnecessary files from the repo

1. MainWindow refactor
    - Functionality:
        - After merging, if no problems it should commit with the default message
    - Diff widget
        - Add file vs file diff as option (Check options: DiffEditor plugin from QtCreator or other)

2. Improvements & Bugs & Fixes
- Add colors to differentiate between local and remote tags
- Study how to show untracked files
- When focus on FullDiffWidget or FileDiffWidget on WIP, update view if something changes
- Show a warning if a merge or cherry-pick reported conflicts. Show the conflicts styled in the unstaged files list.
- Improve readability in the views:
    - Set the text elided and show a tooltip for the branch names longer than 50 px
- Add functionality to squash commits
- Add functionality for patches
- Check what happens when we load gigantic repos

Options
