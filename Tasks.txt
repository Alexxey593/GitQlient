0. Remove unnecessary files from the repo

1. MainWindow refactor
    - Functionality:
        - After merging, if no problems it should commit with the default message
    - Diff widget
        - Add file vs file diff as option (Check options: DiffEditor plugin from QtCreator or other)

2. Improvements & Bugs & Fixes
- Add colors to differentiate between local and remote tags
- Study how to show untracked files
- In unstaged files:
    - Add context menu option to checkout all unstaged files
    - Add context menu option to add to .gitignore a file/pattern
    - Add context menu option to remove files in unstaged list
    - When a file is checkout, change the signalChangesCommit for one to refresh the unstaged files list. Refresh Diff if active, not the whole ui.
    - Disable checkout option if the file is not part of git -> new + unstaged
- Fix amend: When amending a commit not all the files available are shown
- When focus on FullDiffWidget or FileDiffWidget on WIP, update view if something changes
- Show a warning if a merge or cherry-pick reported conflicts. Show the conflicts styled in the unstaged files list.
- Extra: add a disabled option to edit a file that throws a signal with the complete path of the file
Improve readability in the views:
    - Set the text elided and show a tooltip for the branch names longer than 50 px
    - Create a real tree structure for the branches both local and remote, or:
        - Increase the height to 30px of the rows in the QListWidgets and QTreeWidgets in the BranchWidget
- When a checkout is performed, the UI refreshes a lot. Try to disable the FileWatcher
- Add functionality for squash commits
- Add functionality for patches
- Add functionality to add submodules (dialog needed)
- Add styles to the TagDlg
- Add styles to the QScrollBar
- Check what happens when we load gigantic repos
- Add License in the repo and the Contributions Guidelines

Options
- Implement the options screen: for the moment only Git related options

File diff:
- How we handle when a file changes its directory?

Full diff:
- Move to the file diff chunck when user clics the file

Future:
- Implement modification browsing in FileDiffView
